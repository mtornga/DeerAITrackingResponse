## Make a few concise, visual demos
1. The calibration process is a great candidate. The agent is using its perception (rtsp capture) and my measuring tape results to improve itself.
2. Camera view to 2d homography is cool.
3. Demo of MCP tools that prove useful. 


## Outdoors
1. Measure the back yard deer detection zone.
2. Create pipelines to detection motion on the outdoor reolink 3 stream, determine motion type (animal, human, other), capture clip, run full detection on clip, turn into coordinate paths, insert into database. 

## Indoors
1. Get the cutebot moving. Use agent to self-improve the movements and perception of position on the board.
2. Create scripts to react to horse detection and move to the area. 
3. Pay down some of this helper debt. Probably won't have the coordinate labels or heading labels in the yard. The big green arrow on cutebot is a "maybe" for the outdoor version.
