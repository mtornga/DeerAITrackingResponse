  "notes": "Used the white bumper tip under the green arrow (AprilTag not clearly visible). Relative to the labeled corners/midpoints and the green plus at (15,12), the nose is roughly 0.3 in right of center and ~0.3 in toward the back from center. Perspective tilt and slight glare add uncertainty. For higher accuracy: keep the AprilTag fully visible and flat, avoid glare, and keep the nose clear of the green plus."
