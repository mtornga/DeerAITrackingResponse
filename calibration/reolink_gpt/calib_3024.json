  "notes": "Used the printed corner and midpoint labels plus the center green plus to anchor the 24x30 in board and then estimated the AprilTag center on the CuteBot near the bottom-right. The tag is visible and close to both the bottom and right edges, roughly ~0.8\u20131.0 in from each. Perspective and slight glare on the white bumper introduce uncertainty. Accuracy would improve with a larger or higher-contrast tag centered on the nose, keeping the bot a bit farther from the edges, and capturing from a slightly higher, more overhead angle or using a calibrated homography from the labeled corners."
