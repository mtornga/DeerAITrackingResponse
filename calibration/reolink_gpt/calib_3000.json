  "notes": "Used the printed corner and midpoint labels plus the green center cross to anchor the board geometry. The CuteBot is near the (30,0) corner; the small AprilTag on the front deck is visible and its center was taken as the nose. Perspective and slight glare near the bottom-left edge introduce error; a larger, flatter-mounted tag or dual tags on the nose, plus a fixed homography calibration per session, would improve accuracy."
