  "notes": "Used the tagged board corners/midpoints and the center green plus to infer a homography and then located the CuteBot by the AprilTag centered on the front deck (aligned with the green arrow tip). The tag is small and partially foreshortened; slight perspective and shadowing near the bottom edge introduce error. A larger AprilTag, consistent lighting, and an overhead calibration shot (showing all four board corners clearly) would improve accuracy."
